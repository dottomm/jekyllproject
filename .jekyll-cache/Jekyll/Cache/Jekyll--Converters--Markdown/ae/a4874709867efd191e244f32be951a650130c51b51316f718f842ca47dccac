<p>I posted on a Reddit thread that I found the Nike â€˜swooshâ€™ offensive. 
<!--more-->I am sure iâ€™m not the only one to feel this way about a insigna with more worth than some countries</p>

<p>A reddit r/user xxxxx asked me what I found so offensive about it. And I started refelcting on why it is that I am offended by the Nike insignia.</p>

<p>â€œIs this just a anti-consumerism bias?â€</p>

<p>â€œOf Course there is, but I am not ignorant in the methodoligies of capitalism.â€</p>

<p>I am old enough to remember the first Nike products. I remember the swoosh. 
Nike built itâ€™s entire empire on the â€˜swooshâ€™ by simply printing it on t-shirts. A symbol of the Ammerican Dream. People will buy anything.</p>

<p>To me the swoosh is the flag of exploitation.</p>

<p>To me it is a symbol reminding me that someone probably died today so I, an American, can live a privleged lifestyle.</p>

<p>To me it symbolizes disregard for fair-labor practices.</p>

<p>To me it highlights child exploitation.</p>

<p>I love Rory â€” like a lot,  and dream of us meeting and falling in love then spending the rest of our lives  playing the local muni near my house together, but I gotta say itâ€™s a litte cringy for me â€” him, â€˜taking the high roadâ€™ â€” while wearing the swoosh. The swoosh is itâ€™s own elite level of wealth built on blood money. If the swoosh wasnâ€™t on Roryâ€™s hat I am sure Rory would be considering signing on to LIV too.</p>

<p>My disdain for the swoosh goes beyond Nike the corporation. I know that Nike isnâ€™t the only glabal manufacutrer building an empire exploiting other countries peoples. Itâ€™s just, the unique and powerful logo they created (and famously under-paid the creator for), sybolizes  modern capitalistic template wielded against economcially challenged nations for decades, to extract and export a nations collective wealth while promising and never delivering new untold riches.</p>

<p>I think Nike makes good products. Everyone seems to love their shoes. I was really impressed with the golf equipment they produced.
But I also think the way that Nike entered and then abandoned the golf equipment industry, leaving hundreds of golf industies employees jobless overnight is an example of the â€˜choicesâ€™ a dollar chasing buisness will make to protect profits, ironically â€” â€˜at any costâ€™.</p>

<p>Nations who donâ€™t grow up playing and learning the rules of the game Monopoly. Who donâ€™t see any profits when they work for the corportations their corrupt leaders chose for them.</p>

<p>Obviously heâ€™s only trying to protect his legacy and I donâ€™t blame him. If the PGA Tour is taken out by LIV. It will be terrible for history. Golfâ€™s legacy and his own will be bifucated.</p>

<p>Nike, to me is sort of the expectation of what modern exploitation looks like. They pefected it im my opinion.</p>

<p>I am sure you all know someone who will drive 15 miles to save 15 cents a gallon on gas. After the wear and tear on the vehicle and the extra cost of gas needed to travel to the gas station, the amount of money saved becomes neglible because you need to consider the cost of your time and the misery of navigating acreoss town to find the gas as well.</p>

<p>And I also admit that Nike isnâ€™t the only glabal manufacutrer building an empire exploiting other countries peoples. Itâ€™s just that the very uniqwue and powerful logo they created and famously under-paid the creator for sybolizes a template thatâ€™s been useed succesfully on nations for the last 20 years</p>

<p>We, the ones who reaped the harvests of capitalism are now seeing the sysytem we perfected used against us.</p>

<p>We set the rules, and now we have to live with them. 
 I own Nike products. Itâ€™s practically impossible not to where I live.</p>

<p>When he took the 10mm dollar Nike deal, I felt the same way I feel about LIV Golf guys. I get it. How does anyone turn down that kind of money. What kind of offer do you think LIV offered Rory?  I would guess 100mil. Heâ€™s the successor of the crown. Heâ€™s the best player on the planet â€” regardless of his record and heâ€™s been a great foot soldier for the PGA. But I think it get a little cringy with him â€˜taking the high roadâ€™ â€” while wearing the swoosh. If the swoosh is itâ€™s own elite level of wealth. The PGA Tour players that are getting endorsement money from Nike are rich. Really fucking rich. If the swoosh wasnâ€™t on his hat I am sure Rory would be signing on too.</p>

<p>In fact my disdain for the swoosh gows beyond Nike the corporation. Nike is sort of the figure-head of what capitalism could get away with. They may have even perfected the template.</p>

<p>Taking the lead from corporations like Levi Strauss and Coca-Cola, Nike took advantage of unequal labor costs and American consumerism tendancies â€” who beleived shopping was the force behind saving money.</p>

<p>The swoosh stands on itâ€™s own for what it represents. Economies devouring smaller economies for fractions of percentage profits. Invisible profit margins taken from the backs of their collegues.</p>

<p>Like if there was a law against picking up pennies and dimes even nickles found in the street because the capitalism says it belongs to the market.</p>

There was a time when â€˜graphic tees didnâ€™t even exsistâ€™ outside of 60â€™s and 70â€™s concert tees.  Graphic tees could be found in tourist areas at stores like Crazy Shirts, a tourist botique  t-shirt store with â€˜whacky logosâ€™ that was as synonimus with U.S tourism as AppleBees is today.</p>
