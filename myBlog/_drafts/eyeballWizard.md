__Jaks: Punks, Hellraisers, Social Plague, Skateboard Hockey Club, And Now Librettists__

“What the hell is Jaks Team?” is a question I have to answer a lot. I say the same thing every time:

“They’re like the Hells Angels of skateboarding.”
<!--more-->
I think this is a fair description of a gang of skateboard misfits, but it’s not very accurate. Unlike Hells Angels, Jaks don’t run guns, manufacture methamphetamines, or dabble in racketeering, but a lot like Hells Angels, they wear “colors”: denim vests covered in patches with an iconic eyeball painted on back. And they raise hell—not on motorcycles, but on skateboards and in mosh pits.

Jaks have nicknames like Melvis, Blue Lagoon, and Goose. They take over skateparks and crash the local bars in numbers. They’ll throw beer bottles at your favorite band if they like them and throw bar stools if they don’t. Some are sober, most are wasted, and the old ones are worn and crippled. They are armed with skateboards and fireworks instead of knives and chains. Hauling drums, guitars, and amplifiers, Jaks will show up to party anywhere there's a good spot to skate.

Every July 1 (Canada Day) through July 4th (America Day) a Jaks "convention" is held. Jaks from Vancouver, Canada to Long Beach, California come together with their best bands, their best skateboarders, and best skateboard hockey players to represent their divisions and countries in a weekend of absolute debauchery. This year they united in Petaluma, California to beat the shit out of each other in their annual skateboard hockey tournament until the best team wins.

What the hell is skateboard hockey? Skateboard hockey is hockey reimagined by skateboarding punks, played on skateboards instead of skates, and on burning asphalt instead of ice. In skateboard hockey, you don't use a traditional hockey puck. An empty Fosters or Sapporo can—the large, steel ones—is required. The can begins the game erect, but in minutes it is smeared flat and flies with the wind. The edges are sharp, real sharp, and like real hockey, blood will spill. Helmets and pads are allowed, but not required. People get hurt. And while "rules are for squares,” they do insist that “you have to keep at least one foot on the board when you shoot the puck.”

Visionary Tom Scott is the founder and “wizard” of the Jaks Team. He lost his leg in a gruesome accident at age 45 on a December morning in 1999 when he was skating to work on a narrow San Francisco street and his messenger bag got snagged on a passing, meandering, lost delivery truck. Tom was dragged under the wheels and his entire leg was taken off just below the hip. The truck driver claims that he looked in his rearview mirror at the very moment Tom's leg was amputated and the driver sued Tom (unsuccessfully) for "mental distress."

Scott now crutches around with a skateboard under his remaining foot. His energy is limitless and his attitude is contagious. When he is not playing team leader, mentor, or life coach to the younger Jaks, while kicking ass and keeping order with the elder Jaks, he is organizing hockey games and punk shows and driving to skateparks or trespassing backyard pools with his team.

For the last two years, like everything else, the Jaks convention was suspended due to Covid. So Tom turned his energy to something new. Theater. When you’re a punk rock zealot like Tom Scott and you spend your whole life shredding over the lines and destroying societal norms, embracing theater is the next obvious step. As a 40-year witness to skateboarding’s history, Tom embarked on a mission to “set the record straight” by writing and producing the world’s very first skate opera: 20/20 Eyeball Wizard, Tom Scott’s vision (pun intended) of the history of skateboarding. It was performed at this year’s convention on The Phoenix Theater’s stage in Petaluma (Tom’s hometown). 

Using stage, live music, choreography, and historic film footage, Scott tells the story of the birth of skate rock from skateboarding’s dark-ages (1950s) to the present. The very first skate opera demonstrates the obstacles that were overcome by the individual’s need for expression through shredding and stoking. Like the invention of urethane wheels and modern precision ball bearings, 20/20 Eyeball Wizard argues that the invention and evolution of skate rock was a crucial element in influencing the culture of the once forbidden, but now uber-American pastime, that helped usher in the genre of “extreme sports”: skateboarding.

Recruiting from in-house, Tom Scott called on bands Verbal Abuse, The Fuck Ups, and Canada's Fully Crazed to supply the soundtrack. A slew of local bands and musicians also pitched in and played throughout the performance while even more skaters volunteered to provide the visuals—mostly just shredding the shit out of the ramps that were arranged on stage and around the theater.

After the performance was over and the theater closed, punks and pagans descended upon Petaluma’s idyllic city center as notorious bands flocked to town filling stage slots at local bars. Members of the Dwarves new project, HeWhoCannotBeNamed, and San Francisco legends, The Fuck Ups and Verbal Abuse, turned out blistering punk, inspiring epic mosh-pits, and dishing out hangovers and bruises night after night.

The soundtrack to 20/20 Eyeball Wizard and a video of the performance will soon be released along with a coffee table book filled with a lifetime of Jaks photos, flyers, and storytelling curated by Tom Scott and friends.
