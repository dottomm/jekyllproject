I should have known better. <!--more--> I needed some content. I suspected sharing the story with Tom would be a problem. 

Didn't care. Met with Tom. Shared the story. It's done. Here it is. Deal with it. 

But, ah fuck. There were two, two Scotts. 

Slade Scott came to represent his father and to protect his father's legacy. 

I am in way over my head. 

Tom had only got to the second sentence when he was reminded that earlier this summer, in just June actually he mourned over the death of Sonny Barger —— with Sonny's family I learned that Sonny Barger and Tom had become close over the last decade, that their relationship started when The Hells Angles removed Jaks Team from the 'enemies' list after years of issuing death threats toward Jaks. 

I didn't bother to ask. I figured  I already knew the answer. 

"Why would The Hells Angles issue death threats toward Jaks Team?"

"It's because the jackets? Right? The Vests?"  

Trying to look like the toughest gang in the scence? 

I'm can only assume that the biker gang was miffed that the little skater twerps copped their style.  

I don't know and I didn't have time to ask. Shit started moving fast but Tom hadn't made it throught the entire sentence yet, so I just hoped he would understand "I don't mean any disrepect, man". 

At the front of a small chinese restaraunt, Tom, Slade and I went over, line by line the entire story. 

First Edit. "Why did you use my name?"

"Too Late, Tom."
